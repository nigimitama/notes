<h2>ナイーブな推定量と正則化バイアス<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>話を簡潔にするために、サンプルを2つにランダム分割するとしよう：メインパートは<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>サンプルで<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\in I\)</span>のインデックスで表し、補助パートは<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N-n\)</span>として<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i \in I^c\)</span>とする。単純のため<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=N/2\)</span>とする。補助パートのサンプルで<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{g}_0\)</span>を獲得し、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_0\)</span>の推定にメインパートのサンプルを使うことにする</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\hat{\theta}_0 = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} D_i^2 \right)^{-1}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} D_i (Y_i - \hat{g}_0(X_i))
\tag{1.3}
\]</div>
<p>推定量<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\theta}_0\)</span>は一般に<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\sqrt{n}\)</span>より遅い収束レート、つまり</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
|\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}_0 - \theta_0)| \overset{p}{\to} \infty
\]</div>
<p>となる。</p>
<p>この「劣った」振る舞いの背後には<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_0\)</span>の学習におけるバイアスがある。</p>
<p>ヒューリスティックにこの<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{g}_0\)</span>の学習のバイアスのインパクトを説明すると、スケールされた<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\theta}_0\)</span>の推定誤差は</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}_0 - \theta_0) =

<p>である。</p>
<p>第1項<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>は<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a \rightsquigarrow N(0, \bar{\Sigma})\)</span>となるので問題ない。第2項の<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>の項は正則化バイアス項で、一般に中心にならず発散する。first orderで以下を得る</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
b = (E[D_i^2])^{-1}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i\in I}
m_0(X_i)(g_0(X_i) - \hat{g}_0(X_i)) + o_P(1)
\]</div>
<p>ヒューリスティックには、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>は平均がゼロにならない<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_0(X_i)(g_0(X_i) - \hat{g}_0(X_i))\)</span>の<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>個の総和で、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>で割られる。これらの項は非ゼロの平均になる。なぜなら高次元あるいは複雑な問題設定のために我々はlasso, ridge, boostingあるいはpenalized neural netsなどの正則化推定量を採用するためである。</p>
<p>それらの推定量において正則化は推定量の分散が爆発しないようにするものの相当なバイアスを引き起こす。とりわけ、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_0\)</span>への<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{g}_0\)</span>のバイアスの収束レートは、RMSEにおいて<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^{-\phi_g}\)</span>（<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_g &lt; 1/2\)</span>）である。ゆえに<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>は<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_i\)</span>が<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_0(X_i)\neq 0\)</span>で中心化されるとき<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{n} n^{-\phi_g} \to \infty\)</span>の確率的オーダーになることが期待され、よって<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}_0 - \theta_0)| \overset{p}{\to} \infty\)</span>となる</p>

<h3>直交化による正則化バイアスの打破<a class="headerlink" href="#id11" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>直交化されたregressor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V=D-m_0(X)\)</span>を得るためにDからXの効果をpartialling outすることにより得られる直交化された式（orthogonalized formulation）を使う。具体的には</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\hat{V} = D - \hat{m}_0(X)
\]</div>
<p>ここで<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{m}_0\)</span>は補助的サンプル（auxiliary sample）からを用いたML推定量。</p>
<p>DからXの効果をpartialling out したあとは、main sampleを使って<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_0\)</span>のdebiased ML (DML)を構築する</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\check{\theta}_0 = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i D_i \right)^{-1}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i (Y_i - \hat{g}_0(X_i))
\]</div>
<p>近似的にDをXについて直交化し、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_0\)</span>の推定値を引くことで近似的に交絡の直接効果を除去することで、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\check{\theta}_0\)</span>は(1.3)の正則化バイアスを除去している。</p>

<p>スケールされた推定誤差は３つの要素に分解できる</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\sqrt{n}(\check{\theta}_0 - \theta_0)
= a^* + b^* + c^*
\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a^*\)</span>はmild conditionsのもとで以下を満たす</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
a^* = (E[V^2])^{-1}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i\in I} V_i U_i \rightsquigarrow N(0, \Sigma)
\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b^*\)</span>は<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_0, m_0\)</span>の推定における正則化バイアスの影響を捉える。具体的には</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
b^* = (E[V^2])^{-1}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i\in I} 
(\hat{m}_0(X_i) - m_0(X_i))
(\hat{g}_0(X_i) - g_0(X_i))
\]</div>
<p>で、これは<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{m}_0\)</span>と<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{g}_0\)</span>の推定誤差の積に依存する。そのため、幅広い範囲のデータ生成過程のもとで消失させることが可能である。</p>
<p>実際、この項は<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{n}n^{-(\phi_m+\phi_g)}\)</span>で上界になり、ここで<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^{-\phi_m}, n^{-\phi_g}\)</span>はそれぞれ<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{m}_0, \hat{g}_0\)</span>の<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_0, g_0\)</span>への収束レートである。これは両者が比較的遅い収束レートで推定されたとしても、消失しうる。</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^*\)</span>は</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
c^* = o_P(1)
\]</div>
<p>となる。これが弱い条件のもとで成り立つことを保証するにあたって、sample splittingが重要な役割を果たす。</p>

<p>sample splittingは<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^*\)</span>が確率的に消失するために使われる。</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^*\)</span>は
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(

などの項を含む。この項は推定誤差と構造的未観測要因の積の和を\)</span>1/\sqrt{n}$-normalizedしたものである。</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E[V_i|X_i]=0\)</span>であることを思い出すと、この項は平均ゼロで分散は
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in I} (\hat{g}_0(X_i) - g_0(X_i))^2
\overset{p}{\to}

\)</span>$
であることがわかり、チェビシェフの不等式を使って確率的には消失することがわかる。</p>
<p>sample splittingの欠点は推定に使用するサンプル数が減ることによる効率性の低下である。しかし、mainとauxiliaryの2つでそれぞれ推定を行い、両者の平均を取ればfull efficiencyを取り戻す。この手続き（mainとauxiliaryの役割を取り替えて複数の推定値を取得しそれらの平均をとる）を「<strong>cross-fitting</strong>」と呼ぶことにする。一般にk-foldにすることもできる。Section 3で詳細を述べる。</p>

<p>モデルのパラメータをモーメント推定する際に、未知の関数をノンパラ推定量で置換してモーメント推定する推定量。

<h3>プラグイン推定量の漸近正規性<a class="headerlink" href="#id16" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>プラグイン推定量が漸近正規性をもつためには、次の2つの条件が鍵となる</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_n(\hat\eta) - \nu(\eta_0) \overset{p}{\to} 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{n}E[m(X_i, \theta_0, \hat\eta)] = o_p(1)\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>なお<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m(\cdot)\)</span>はモーメント条件を構成する既知の関数で、<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_n\)</span>は経験過程（empirical process）とよばれる関数</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\nu_n(\eta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n ( m(X_i, \eta) - E[m(X_i, \eta)] )
\]</div>
<p>である。</p>
<p>ノンパラメトリック推定量の漸近理論ではDonsker条件を用いて条件1を示すことが多いようだが、高次元ではDonsker条件は満たされない</p>
<p>対処法のひとつは標本分割（sample splitting）だが、標本分割すると効率性が低下する。Chernozkov et al. (2018)ではCross-fittingにより効率性を落とさずに推定できることを示した</p>
